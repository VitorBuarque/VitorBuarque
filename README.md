# Exercise from Blanchard's Macroeconomics book
I was studying macroeconomics and tried to make this graph in python. It may be simple, but I am very proud of the result, so I decided to share it. This is the first graph i made from scratch!
# Chapter 1
3. Chinese economic growth is the outstanding feature of the world economic scene over the past two decades.

    a. In 2014, U.S. output was $17.4 trillion, and Chinese output was $10.4 trillion.
    Suppose that from now on, the output of China grows at an annual rate of 6.5% per year,
    whereas the output of the United States grows at an annual rate of 2.2% per year.
    These are the values in each country for the period 2010â€“2014 as stated in the text.
    Using these assumptions and a spreadsheet, calculate and plot U.S. and Chinese output from 2014 over the next 100 years.
    How many years will it take for China to have a total level of output equal to that of the United States?
